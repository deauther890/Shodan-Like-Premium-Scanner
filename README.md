This project will bypass the need of a premium subscription or a student account for shodan services to download premium data. It can gather live ips, open ports, and services. It uses masscan to scan for ports. Also, I uses Nmap service probes file to identify the services. This script can be considered as a shodan-like python scanner.
When running the script, it will ask for filename (incase of list of ips needed) ip (single or range), port, version and version number and then it will filter the ips according to the version and/or version number specified by the user. Please install masscan before using this script (`sudo apt install masscan`). Also, put Nmap-service-probes file in the same directory to be parsed by the python script.
